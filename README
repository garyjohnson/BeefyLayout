Currently StackPanel and supporting files are in BeefyLayoutHarness project, but eventually they will be split out into a seperate project. To use BeefyLayout, include the following files in your project: 
 *StackPanel.h
 *StackPanel.m
 *UIView+BeefyLayout.h
 *UIView+BeefyLayout.m.

To run the project tests, you will need Kiwi (submodule). From the root directory, run
git submodule init
git submodule update
